# Program\_03\_4
## Requirements
* Create a program that
    * Has a vector containing 5 of your favorite numbers (or just any numbers)
    * Asks a user to guess your favorite number
    * Uses a for loop to parse through your favorite numbers vector to compare
    * If the guess is one of your favorite numbers
        * Reply with "Good guess! \<number\> is one of my favorite numbers."
    * If the guess is not one of your favorite numbers
        * Reply with "Good guess, but \<number\> not one of my favorite numbers."
    * Only exits once a favorite number is guessed, otherwise, continues to ask.
* Name the program file **Program\_03\_4.m**
* Your output should match the output shown below.
* Add the standard comments similar to those that appear at the top of each tutorial and clearly label your output following the example shown below.

## Program
Use the code below to start your M file and complete the requirements stated above
### Tips
* Break it into parts
    * Maybe start with asking for a number and parsing to see if it's correct
    * Then wrap it in a while loop so it asks repeatedly
    * Or, the other way aroundâ€¦
* You may use whatever numbers you want, they don't need to match mine
