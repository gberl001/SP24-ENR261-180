# Program\_05\_4
## Requirements
Create matrices `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and e as efficiently as you possibly can such that they appear as shown in the [Example Output](#example-output) section below.
**DO NOT** use brute force, creating matrices manually with bracket or colon notation.
You may **ONLY** use subscript notation and functions.
Colon notation is allowed in subscripts. ex: `a(1:5,3:5)= 0;`

* Name the program file **Program\_05\_4.m**
* Your output should match the output shown below.
* Add the standard comments similar to those that appear at the top of each tutorial and clearly label your output following the example shown below.

## Program

Some functions you may find useful are as follows, though you're welcome to find
* ones()
* zeros()
* eye()
* flipud()
* fliplr()
* repmat()
* rot90()
