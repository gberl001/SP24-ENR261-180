* The mean slider bar shall start at a value of 100 and range from 100 to 200
* The standard deviation slider bar shall start at a value of 10 and range from 10 to 50
* Shall display the random numbers in a histogram with the initial data on startup
* The histogram shall have 50 bins
* Shall adjust the histogram plot upon selecting a new mean or standard deviation
* The mean and std dev sliders shall be labeled accordingly
* The histogram plot shall be labeled, and titled accordingly
* The code for generating the plot shall not be duplicated, the code shall have one function for generating and populating the plot data
