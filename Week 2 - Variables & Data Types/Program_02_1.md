I have provided you with a "skeleton" of what your program should look like, in the future you will be given a blank code block to be filled out from scratch.
* Add an `fprintf` statement before each exercise to display the message "Output for exercise..." before each solution, the first `fprintf` is given for you, copy/paste and edit for the remaining exercises. We learn about `fprintf` in detail in week 3.
